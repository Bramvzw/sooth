# Decisions

An ADR-style log of non-trivial choices. Newest entries at the bottom. Add an
entry whenever you make a decision that isn't obvious from the code, so
nobody (including future-you) re-litigates it without context.

## Why Rust

Fits the target-language diversity of the test suites `sooth` needs to
observe (it has to run alongside pytest, PHPUnit, Jest, Go — not compete with
their own ecosystem's tooling), gives a single portable binary with no
runtime to install, and matches the language of the recent star-magnets in
this space (`television`, `yazi`, `atuin`, `nextest`). It is also a
deliberate portfolio choice.

## Why local-first instead of a server/dashboard

Tools like ReportPortal and Allure take the server+dashboard+history shape
and plateau in adoption despite company backing. The k6/television/yazi shape
— local, instant, single-binary — is the one that pulls stars in this niche.
`sooth` commits to that shape: no service to run, no account, no history
store. It observes one run and reports on it.

## Why the name `sooth`

Short for "in sooth" (truly) — matches the "the truth about your tests"
positioning without borrowing a generic testing term. The crate name and
GitHub repo (`Bramvzw/sooth`) were claimed early to reserve the name.

## Presets instead of pure framework-agnosticism

There is no real JUnit-XML standard, and producing that report isn't free for
every runner (pytest and PHPUnit emit it natively; Jest needs `jest-junit`;
Go needs `gotestsum`). Claiming "framework-agnostic, works everywhere with no
setup" generates a stream of "doesn't work for me" issues that a solo
maintainer can't sustain. Instead, `sooth` promises: works out-of-the-box
with pytest, PHPUnit, Jest and Go via built-in presets that inject the right
reporter flags; bring your own JUnit XML for everything else.

## Flaky and order-dependence are strictly separated

Shuffling test order and repeating runs are different signals that pollute
each other if combined: a test that only fails under certain orderings looks
"flaky" under shuffled repeats. `sooth` never shuffles and repeats in the same
pass. Flaky detection uses a fixed order repeated N times; order-dependence
detection uses shuffled orders compared against each other, with no
repetition. See `ROADMAP.md` for how this maps to versions.

## Network egress as a separate spike, decoupled from the launch

Per-test attribution of network calls is the hardest part of the whole
project: all tests run in one subprocess, so an external observer (proxy or
sniffer) can't tell which test made a given connection without either
per-framework hooks (which breaks the agnostic promise) or running every test
in its own process (which is slow). HTTPS also requires the target process to
honor a proxy or trust a MITM certificate, and reliable interception
mechanisms (eBPF) are Linux-only for now. False negatives — reporting "no
egress" when there was one — are the worst failure mode for a tool whose
entire value proposition is telling the truth.

Given that, egress detection is a separate, hard-timeboxed (3-4 week) R&D
effort that starts Linux-only, proxy-honoring-clients-only, with documented
limitations. It ships as its own release if it succeeds; the v1.0 launch does
not wait for it and stands on flaky + slow + order-dependence alone.

## Work is tracked in GitHub Issues, not a ticket board

`sooth` is a personal OSS project — no JIRA, no external board. Work is planned
GitHub-native:
- **Milestones = versions** (`v0.1 skeleton`, `v0.2 flaky`, `v0.3 slow+order`,
  `v1.0 launch`, `egress spike`).
- **Epics = theme issues** (label `epic`): Core run pipeline, Flaky detection,
  Slow & order analysis, Distribution & packaging, Launch & docs, Network egress.
- **Stories = issues under an epic** (label `story`), each assigned to a milestone.
- Commit subjects use the `PREFIX:` convention (no ticket numbers); optionally
  reference an issue with `(#n)`.
- Overview lives in GitHub milestones (source of truth) + optionally a GitHub
  Project board; `ROADMAP.md` holds the human-readable narrative.

## clap (derive) for the CLI, and the test command after `--`

The CLI uses `clap`'s derive API. The wrapped test command is captured as a
trailing argument list after `--` (`sooth run -- pytest -k foo`), modeled with
clap's `last = true`. This keeps sooth's own flags (`--preset`, `--runs`, …)
unambiguous from the flags of the command it wraps. Until the runner lands
(story #2), `sooth run` only echoes the parsed plan so the CLI surface is
testable now without spawning a process.

## The runner inherits the child's stdio and captures only exit status + time

`sooth`'s runner spawns the test command with inherited stdio, so you see your
test output exactly as if you had run it yourself, and records only the exit
code and wall-clock time per run. It deliberately does not buffer the child's
output: the structured signal comes from the JUnit XML the runner produces
(parsed in story #3), not from scraping stdout. Runs execute in a fixed order;
shuffling for order-dependence is a separate pass (see above).
